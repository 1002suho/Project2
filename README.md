Scientific question:
Would breast cancer cells have different expression of estrogen receptor coregulator genes, FOXA1 and GATA3, than endometrial cancer cells? Also, would they respond differently to estrogen through their unique cellular pathways?

Scientific hypothesis:
If FOXA1 and GATA3 ER-responsive genes are more expressed in breast cancer cells compared to endometrial cancer cells, then breast cancer cells would have unique cellular pathways to respond to estrogen.
