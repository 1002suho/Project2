Scientific question:
Would endometrial cancer cells have different expression of estrogen receptor coregulator genes, FOXA1 and GATA3, than breast cancer cells? Also, would they respond differently to estrogen through their unique cellular pathways?Â¶

Scientific hypothesis:
If FOXA1 and GATA3 ER-responsive genes are differentially expressed in endometrial cancer cells compared to breast cancer cells, then endometrial cancer cells would have unique cellular pathways to respond to estrogen.
